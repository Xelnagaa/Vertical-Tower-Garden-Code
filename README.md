Hydroponic Tower Garden

The vertical farm tower has temperature, humidity and light sensors. These sensors are used to monitor the environment of the tower garden. LED growth lights will be used to provide more light for the plants when needed. The LED lighting will be controlled by a timer that is set by the user. The light timer sets how much light will be given to the plants. That includes external light from other sources like sunlight. For example, if user sets the light timer for 9 hours, but the plants got 6 house of day light. Then the LED lighting will turn on for the remaining 3 hours of light needed. The light sensor is used to determine how much light the plants get. Two water pump timers are used. One is a off timer and the other is the on timer for the water pump. A real time clock is used to set the timers for the water pump and LED lighting. Everything is displayed and controlled by a touch screen LCD display.
