Hydroponic Tower Garden with display 

The vertical farm tower has temperature, humidity and light sensors. These sensors are used to monitor the environment of the tower garden. If the tower garden is being used outside the temperature sensor is used to allow the user to keep track of temperature to make sure his plants wonâ€™t die as the season changes. LED growth lights will be used to provide more light for the plants when needed. The LED lighing will be controlled by a timer that is set by the user.
The light timer sets how much light will be givin to the plants. That includes exturnal light from other sources like sunlight. For example if user sets the light timer for 9 hours, but the plants got 6 house of day light. Then the LED lighting will trun on for the remaining 3 hours of light needed. The light sensor is used to deturmin how much light the plants get. Two water pump timers are used. Once a off timer and the others the on timer for the water pump.
A real time clock is used to diplay the time and is used to set the timers.
Everthing is displayed and controled by a touch screen LCD display.
